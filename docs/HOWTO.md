# Installation

The installation depends on whether you are using [NixOS](#nixos) or [home-manager](#non-nixos-and-home-manager).

Regardless of the chosen approach, the installation consists of:

1. Importing this flake's module
2. Configuring xremap

Note that flakes are required. If there is a demand for non-flake-based modules -- please feel free to submit an issue.

## NixOS

There are two main ways of running xremap -- as a system service or as a user service. Not all combinations of mode x desktop environment are supported:

| Scenario | No features | KDE | Gnome | X11 | Wlroots |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| System | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_multiplication_x: | :heavy_multiplication_x: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_multiplication_x: |
| User   | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark:       | :question: | :heavy_check_mark:           |

For all examples in this section you can copy the code into a random `flake.nix` on your machine and run it in a VM as `nix run <path_to_flake>#nixosConfigurations.nixos.config.system.build.vm`.

  ## System module, no desktop environment
  </summary>

  A very simple configuration that globally maps CapsLock to Escape and Ctrl+U to Page Up can look like this:
  
  ```nix
  # flake.nix
  {
    inputs.xremap-flake.url = "github:xremap/nix-flake";
    outputs = inputs@{ nixpkgs, ... }: {
      nixosConfigurations.nixos = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        system = "x86_64-linux";
        modules = [
          inputs.xremap-flake.nixosModules.default
          /* This is effectively an inline module */
          {
            users.users.root.password = "hunter2";
            system.stateVersion = "24.05";
  
            # Modmap for single key rebinds
            services.xremap.config.modmap = [
              {
                name = "Global";
                remap = { "CapsLock" = "Esc"; }; # globally remap CapsLock to Esc
              }
            ];
  
            # Keymap for key combo rebinds
            services.xremap.config.keymap = [
              {
                name = "Example ctrl-u > pageup rebind";
                remap = { "C-u" = "PAGEUP"; };
                # NOTE: no application-specific remaps work without features (see configuration)
              }
            ];
          }
        ];
      };
    };

## Non-NixOS and home-manager

Since on non-NixOS configurations, the environment outside the user cannot be controlled (e.g. home-manager cannot add the user to `uinput`), additional steps may be needed. See [upstream](https://github.com/k0kubun/xremap) for more information.

# Xremap service configuration

There are three categories of options:

1. `enabled` option; true by default for mostly historic reasons.
2. Options that enable package features (support for X/Wayland) or service configuration.

    Feature flags are:

    * `withWlroots`, `bool` – whether to enable wlroots-based compositor support (Sway, Hyprland, etc.)
    * `withGnome`, `bool` – whether to enable Gnome support
    * `withX11`, `bool` – whether to enable X11 support
    * `withKDE`, `bool` – whether to enable KDE wayland support
    * `withHypr`, `bool` – whether to enable non-wlroots based Hyprland support

    All of them are false by default, which means no application-specific remaps work as xremap does not know which application is being used.

    * `serviceMode`, `str` – whether to run as user ("`user`") or system ("`system`", default)
    * `userName`, `str` – Name of user logging into graphical session (not set by default)
    * `userId`, `int` – user under which IPC socket runs (1000 by default)
    * `watch`, `bool` – whether to watch for new devices (false by default)
    * `mouse`, `bool` – whether to watch for mice (false by default)
    * `deviceNames`, `list of str`, – list of devices to monitor (empty by default)
    * `extraArgs`, `list of str`, – list of arguments to provide for xremap (empty by default)
    * `package` – which package for xremap to use. Useful if you want to somehow override the flake-provided package.
    * `debug` – enables debug logging for xremap (off by default)

3. Options that define xremap's config. See [upstream](https://github.com/k0kubun/xremap) for more options.

    They are defined in either `services.xremap.config` as a Nix attrset or in `services.xremap.yamlConfig` as raw YAML text.


# Troubleshooting

## Cannot launch applications

If there is a binding to launch an application that looks like this:

```nix
{
  name = "apps";
  remap.alt-f.launch = [ "pavucontrol" ];
}
```

But nothing happens, and you see this in the logs:

```
Jan 01 19:30:46 nix xremap[595413]: [2024-01-01T16:30:46Z DEBUG xremap::action_dispatcher] Running command: ["pavucontrol"]
Jan 01 19:30:46 nix xremap[650912]: [2024-01-01T16:30:46Z ERROR xremap::action_dispatcher] Error running command: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
```

This happens because of a discrepancy in `$PATH` variable between your environment and xremap service.

Two approaches to solve this:
1. Use binds to something like `${lib.getExe pkgs.pavucontrol}`
2. (not applicable to all DEs) use the bind to call DE-specific utility, e.g. `hyprctl exec <binary>`. This way whatever UI customizations are present on the DE level will get propagated to launched binary.

## (specific to X11) xremap starts but app-specific shortcuts are not working

If you are using X11 and have enabled `withX11`, but the application-specific keybinds do not work, check the logs (`journalctl -u xremap`).

Should the logs contain:

```
Failed to connect to X11: X11 setup failed: 'Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified
```

You would need to run `xhost +SI:localuser:root`. One approach to do this is described in [this example config](#systemwide-example-with-x-feature-for-application-specific-remaps).

## Xremap service is not started automatically

Happens if `serviceMode == "user"` or when using home-manager module; typically because `graphical-session.target` is not launched automatically.

If you are using a desktop environment (Gnome, KDE, something wlroots-based, etc.) – make sure that the target is started.

If you intend to use xremap without a DE, change `systemd.user.services.xremap.wantedBy` to some target that starts after you log in or manually start `systemctl --user start xremap`

## Xremap does not restart on config change

Not (yet?) implemented, see #49.

## Something else

Feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/xremap/nix-flake/issues) or reach out to the main contributor of the repo via any other means.
